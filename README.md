                                Asymptotic Analysis
    The algorithm checks for edge cases and returns appropriate values, then it checks for the arithmetic progressions and geometric progressions by keeping track of the minimum differences and maximum differences as well as the minimum and maximum ratios between consecutive elements in the array.
    
   - First if statement to test for empty array: Takes constant time O(1)
   - Instatiations: Take constant time O(1)
   - For loop iterates through entire array once: Takes time Linear with the size of the input O(n)
   
   - Final tests: Take constant time O(1)
   
   
  Final Asymptotic complexity : O(N) = a * O(1) + b * O(1) + O(n) + c * O(1)
                               
                               O(N) approximately=  O(n) 
                               since a, b and c are constants and negligble
